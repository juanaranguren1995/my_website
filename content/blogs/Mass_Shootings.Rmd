# Mass Shootings
We are going to first analyse the data to understand what type of information we can get from the file.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


mass_shootings <- read_csv(here::here("data", "mass_shootings.csv"))

glimpse(mass_shootings)
```

Then we are going to generate our first bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars are sorted from highest to lowest and each bar show its number.

```{r}

#Create the bar chat
bar_chart <- mass_shootings %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = Count, fill = race )) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Number of mass shooters", title = "Number of mass shooters by Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
  
#Show the result
bar_chart
```
