We will be using a dataset with credit card transactions containing legitimate and fraud transactions. Fraud is typically well below 1% of all transactions, so a naive model that predicts that all transactions are legitimate and not fraudulent would have an accuracy of well over 99%â€“ pretty good, no? (well, not quite as we will see later in the course)

You can read more on credit card fraud on Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Weighted Support Vector Machine

The dataset we will use consists of credit card transactions and it includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud.

Obtain the data

The dataset is too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0 and save it in your dsb repo, under the data folder


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

card_fraud <- read_csv(here::here("data", "card_fraud.csv"))

glimpse(card_fraud)

```

In this dataset, how likely are fraudulent transactions? Generate a table that summarizes the number and frequency of fraudulent transactions per year.


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#First we are going to create the table grouped by transaction year that calculates de number of frauds they were and how frequent they occured. As sated by the text, the number should be very low
Fraudulent_Transactions <- card_fraud %>% 
  group_by(trans_year) %>% 
  summarise(Number_Fraud = sum(is_fraud),Frequency = Number_Fraud/n())

#Show result
Fraudulent_Transactions
```
